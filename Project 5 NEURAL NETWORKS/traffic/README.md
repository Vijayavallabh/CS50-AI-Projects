First time I tried as per the Lecture Code I got 90.33%for train and 96.9% for test accuracies.Second time I made activation function of first conv2D as sigmoid and I got 93.4% for train and 97.37% for test accuracies.Then I made all activation as sigmoid except outer layer and I got 97.03% for train and 98.44% for test.At last I changed even the output layer for activation as sigmoid and I got 97.03 for train and 98.25 for test.
